## Team NIM - Problem Statement

Wordle is a popular game that has gained a large following since 2021. Developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle, the game was acquired by the NYTimes in 2022.

There is a potential need for an API that can be integrated between the web-based and mobile applications of the game. The Wordle API should allow developers to easily retrieve words while they manage the game logic and scoring.

Thus, the API is meant to be 'consumed' by other users that are developing similar word-based games like Wordle.
