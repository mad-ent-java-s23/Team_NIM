## Team NIM - Charter

### Purpose and Vision:

- Develop an API for accessing previously used words for the game Wordle

### Objective and Goals:

1. Using the NYTimes [API](https://www.nytimes.com/svc/wordle/v2/), develop an end point where users can access the 'word of the day'
2. Users will be able to:
  - Get the Word of the day
  - Get a word from a date search (limited to the start of the NYTimes acquisition of Wordle - June, 19, 2021)
  - Get all the words up-to-current-date
3. Responses for the GET should look as follows:
   <pre>
   Wordle {
      editor='*who wrote it*', 
      solution='*the word*',      
      id=*some int, 
      printDate='2023-03-01'
   }
   </pre>

### Future Goals: 
1. Develop user-friendly interface that allows players to input guesses
2. Create an algorithm to randomly select a five-letter word and tracks player progression as they attempt to guess the correct word
3. Implement a scoring system â€“ correct guesses, incorrect guesses (tries), etc.
4. Ensure game is accessible to a wide range of users (including those with disabilities or with assistive technologies
