# Team NIM - Resume

### Team Name: Team NIM (not in Madison)

### Project Name - Wordle Clone

### Objectives (EDITED)
#### RESTful API
1. Using the NYTimes [API](https://www.nytimes.com/svc/wordle/v2/), develop an end point where users can access the 'word of the day'
2. Users will be able to:
   - Get the Word of the day
   - Get a word from a date search (limited to the start of the NYTimes acquisition of Wordle - June, 19, 2021)
   - Get all of the words up-to-date
3. Responses for the GET should look as follows:
   <pre>
   Wordle {
      editor='*who wrote it*', 
      solution='*the word*',      
      id=*some int, 
      printDate='2023-03-01'
   }
   </pre>

#### Additional functionalities to be added at a later date
1. Get the Word of the day (NYTimes) and add it to the TeamNIM API automatically
2. Multiple Day search
3. Add the ability to POST a new word to the database, with functionality to check for duplicates and validity:
   - Not only duplicates, but would need to establish a check for whether the POSTed word is an actual word
   - May require using an additional API such as [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://dictionaryapi.com/)
   - *This may also pose potential problems since some words may be considered offensive (see the [Wordle Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle) and the NYTimes acquisition section)


#### Game interface (to be added later)
1. Develop user-friendly interface that allows players to input guesses
2. Create an algorithm to randomly select a five-letter word and tracks player progression as they attempt to guess the correct word
3. Implement a scoring system â€“ correct guesses, incorrect guesses (tries), etc.
4. Ensure game is accessible to a wide range of users (including those with disabilities or with assistive technologies
