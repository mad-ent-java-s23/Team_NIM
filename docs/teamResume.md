# Team NIM - Resume

### Team Name: Team NIM (not in Madison)

### Project Name - Wordle Clone

### Objectives (EDITED)
#### RESTful API
1. Using the NYTimes [API](https://www.nytimes.com/svc/wordle/v2/), develop an end point we users can access the 'word of the day'
2. Additionally, users will be able to search for words in the API by date.  
3. From the Administrator's side, we will utilize the GET, POST, and DELETE methods. For the User, only the GET method will be used
4. Responses for the GET should look as follows:
   <pre>
   WordleAnswers {
      editor='*who wrote it*', 
      solution='*the word*', 
      daysSinceLaunch=*some int*, 
      id=*some int, 
      printDate='2023-03-01'
   }
   </pre>

#### Game interface (this is if there is time)
1. Develop user-friendly interface that allows players to input guesses
2. Create an algorithm to randomly select a five-letter word and tracks player progression as they attempt to guess the correct word
3. Implement a scoring system â€“ correct guesses, incorrect guesses (tries), etc.
4. (optional) Create a DB of words and incorporate features that allow players to choose different categories or levels of difficulty
   - OR
5. Utilize the NYTimes API (or other) to retrieve randomized words already used (randomize the dates to retrieve them)
6. Ensure game is accessible to a wide range of users (including those with disabilities or with assistive technologies

#### Matt:
- Bachelor's degrees in Biology and Microbiology.
- Got a job in a biotech company for a break year before going to med school, became fascinated by the tech, switched from the 'bio' part of the word to the 'tech' part of the word. 
- Worked as an engineer for the last 6 years. Main areas of focus are microfluidics and laser-optics. I design, build and maintain equipment used in labs all around the world (that's how I ended up in Norway).
- Now that I have the 'bio' and the 'tech' portions down, I'm here to learn how how to write code for the machines that I design in order to make me a real swiss army knife.
